## Course 1: Preparing and Modeling Data

In this foundational course from Udacity's **Data Analysis with Power BI Nanodegree**, I learned the essentials of the Power BI data pipeline. The focus was on ingesting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to build a strong foundation for analysis and visualization.

### Key Topics Covered
- **Power BI Data Pipeline Overview**: End-to-end flow from data ingestion to modeling.
- **Connecting to Data Sources**: Importing from files (CSV, Excel), databases, and web sources.
- **Data Transformation with Power Query**: Cleaning, restructuring, and harmonizing datasetsâ€”handling duplicates, merging tables, and using M language functions.

### Skills Learned
- ETL processes using Power Query for data preparation.
- Building star schemas and table relationships in Power BI Desktop.
- Basic DAX calculations (e.g., totals, averages).
- Preparing models for downstream visualization.

### Key Project
The hands-on project involved **importing and cleaning a sales dataset**, modeling it with relationships, and creating a basic report. For example: Transforming raw sales data from Excel/CSV into a unified model, then building a simple dashboard showing performance metrics like revenue by region. This demonstrated real-world data wrangling and ETL best practices for business intelligence.
