Welcome to my portfolio repository for the **Udacity Data Analysis with Power BI Nanodegree**. This project collection demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and storytelling using Microsoft Power BI. Through three structured courses, I analyzed diverse datasets to create interactive dashboards and derive actionable insights.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three folders, each corresponding to one course in the Nanodegree program. Each folder contains:
- **Project files**: Power BI (.pbix) reports and dashboards.
- **Datasets**: Raw and cleaned data files (CSV/Excel).
- **Documentation**: Screenshots, explanations, and key learnings.

| Folder     | Course Focus                  | Key Projects                                      |
|------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **course-1** | Preparing and Modeling Data | Importing and transforming data with Power Query, building models with relationships and DAX; project: Sales data ETL and basic dashboard. |
| **course-2** | Advanced Analytics and DAX    | Intermediate modeling with DAX formulas, relationships, and complex metrics (e.g., customer segmentation analysis). |
| **course-3** | Capstone Project              | End-to-end real-world project integrating all skills (e.g., comprehensive business intelligence report). |

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Preparation**: ETL processes using Power Query.
- **Data Modeling**: Relationships, hierarchies, and calculated columns/measures with DAX.
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts, maps, KPIs, and slicers for storytelling.
- **Best Practices**: Performance optimization, accessibility, and deployment to Power BI Service.
